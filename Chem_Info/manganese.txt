Manganese is a transition metal that is primarily found as a compound in nature.1 It has a few key roles in enzymatic pathways within humans, mainly for its ability to stabilize charges. While high manganese intake through food and drink is unlikely to cause adverse health effects, repeated respiratory exposure can damage the central nervous system. Chronic exposure can result in tremors and muscle spasms. People working in the welding and mining industries are the most likely to be exposed to manganese dust.

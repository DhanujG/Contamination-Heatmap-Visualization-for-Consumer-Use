Strontium is an element that falls under the alkaline earth metal family.1 This family is known to contain elements that, in their purest form, react violently when exposed to water. However, strontium is not usually found in its pure metal form in nature. The metal is primarily used in fireworks or flares to make a red color while also being incorporated into plastics and paints. The health impact of strontium on humans is fairly benign. It does not have a role in any metabolic or biological pathways in humans.2 Humans are exposed to trace amounts of strontium in dust particles. For children who have low calcium and protein in their diets, they are susceptible to strontium’s effect of bone growth.3 To reduce the risk of harmful exposure, children should have a diet high in vitamin D, calcium, and protein to limit strontium absorption.3

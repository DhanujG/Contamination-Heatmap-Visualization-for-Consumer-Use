HCFC-22, also known as chlorodifluoromethane,  is one of the most commonly used refrigerants used in refrigerators and air conditioners worldwide.1 This gas has a large detrimental effect because of its negative effect on the ozone layer. HCFC-22 causes stratospheric ozone depletion. It can also act as a greenhouse gas within the atmosphere.

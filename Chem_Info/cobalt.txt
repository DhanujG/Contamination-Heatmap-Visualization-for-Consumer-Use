Primarily used in industrial processes to increase hardness and prevent corrosion for grinding and cutting1. Cobalt can enter the body through inhalation of vapors, dirt, through drinking water or ingesting it through natural sources where trace amounts of cobalt are already present. While the element is a nutrient necessary for proper human health in trace amounts, excess contact with cobalt, especially through inhalation of cobalt dust, can lead to respiratory irritation and allergic reactions. Exposure to excess cobalt most often occurs through ingesting contaminated food and drinking water. Once absorbed, it is mainly distributed to the liver, kidneys, and bones. Radioactive forms of cobalt are also particularly dangerous to human health, and may lead to the development of certain cancers with continual exposure. However, radioactive cobalt is only found in very few applications, for example in radiotherapy units or in nuclear power plants.

1,4 - dioxane presents as a clear liquid with a sweet odor as well as a moderate to high miscibility in water.1 It was previously used as a stabilizer for chlorination reactions during manufacturing procedures, making it present in dump sites. Normally, 1,4 - dioxane is not found in groundwater because of its short half-life (1-3 days) while in the soil. The chemical is also harmful to human health based on the amount of exposure. Short term exposure can cause nausea, drowsiness, and headaches while long term exposure is potentially carcinogenic.

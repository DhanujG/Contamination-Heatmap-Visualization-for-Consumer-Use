Chlorate is the conjugate base that forms when chloric acid dissociates in solution.1 It is a common by-product from using chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant. Chlorate is also used in producing chlorine dioxide, dyes, explosives, and matches. Chlorate interacts with the body by being absorbed through the GI tract and later broken down into chlorine and other components that are eventually excreted in the urine or feces. Excessive exposure has been found to cause decreased organ weight in dogs, but human impact has not been reported.

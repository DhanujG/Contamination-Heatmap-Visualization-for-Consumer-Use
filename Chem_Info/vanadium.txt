Vanadium is a common transition metal found in freshwater.1 It is abundant in the body, but its biological role is not known at this time. It is thought to act in a similar way to phosphate. Vanadium in homeostatic concentrations is non-toxic, however those in industries where work with vanadium oxides is present are exposed to toxic concentrations. A large amount of ingested vanadium is processed by the body, but any inhalation of vanadium oxides can cause irritation in the eyes, nose, skin, or upper respiratory tract.

Halon 1011, also known as bromochloromethane, is a halomethane compound that 

presents as a liquid at room temperature under normal atmospheric pressure1. The compound is dangerous for ozone layer as well as irritant for eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Halon 1011 is currently used in industry as a fire-extinguishing fluid2. Firefighters and those in the vicinity of its use are most likely to experience its adverse physiological effects. Moreover, there is a risk for water contamination. It moves quickly through the ground and the air, and is eventually broken down through the air.

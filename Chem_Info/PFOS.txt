Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) are synthetic chemicals that humans have introduced into the environment.1 In the past, PFOS were used heavily for industrial manufacturing purposes as lubricants, water-resistant coatings, or in food packaging. These chemicals have been found to hinder immune system function by lowering antibody effectiveness.

Molybdenum is a transition metal that is commonly found as a trace element.1 It has an essential enzymatic function as a component in the cofactor molybdopterin. Humans consume molybdenum through fruits and vegetables, particularly legumes and nuts. While important, molybdenum is quickly excreted from the body through urination, due to its toxicity at high concentration. People working in the mining and metalworking industries have a large chance of high molybdenum exposure.
